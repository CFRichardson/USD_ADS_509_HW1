   You think you know me? You don't know shit I've seen the world through your eyes And it makes me sick I've questioned all of your answers They're fucking lies I won't conform to your system I'd rather die  I'll burn it down just to watch it go I'll burn it down so everybody knows I'll burn it down just to see it torched Burn it downâI hate it to the core  Think you're a martyr Not hard to see You want to rule the fucking world You got to get through me Your iron fist will be broken No soul to sell You think I'll burn for my actions? See you in hell  Burn it downâI do it for myself Burn it downâfor me and no one else I burn it down just to watch it fall Burn it downâI hate you fucking all  I'll burn it down just to watch it go I'll burn it down so everybody knows I burn it down just to see it torched I burn it downâI hate it to the core
