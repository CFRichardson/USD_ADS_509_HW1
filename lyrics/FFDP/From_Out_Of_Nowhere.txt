   Tossed into my mind, stirring the calm You splash me with beauty and then you pull me down Because you came from out of nowhere My glance turns to a stare Obsession rules me, I'm yours from the start I know that you see me, our eyes interlock  Because you came from out of nowhere My glance turns to a stare One minute here and one minute there Don't know if I'll laugh or cry One minute here and one minute there And then you wave goodbye Goodbye  Sifting to the bottom, every day for two Energy funnels, all becomes you Because you came from out of nowhere My glance turns to a stare  One minute here and one minute there Don't know if I'll laugh or cry One minute here and one minute there And then you wave goodbye  One minute here and one minute there And then I'll wave goodbye Goodbye!
