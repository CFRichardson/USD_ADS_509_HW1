   I remember when all the games began Remember every little lie and every last goodbye Promises you broke, words you choked on And I never walked away It's still a mystery to me  Well, I'm so empty I'm better off without you and you're better off without me Well, you're so unclean I'm better off without you and you're better off without me  The lying, the bleeding, the screaming Was tearing me apart The hatred (deceiving), the beatings; it's over  Paint the mirrors black to forget you I still picture your face (still picture your face) And the way you used to taste (way you used to taste) Roses in a glass, dead and wilted To you, this all was nothing Everything to you is nothing  Well, you're so filthy I'm better off without you and you're better off without me Well, I'm so ugly You're better off without me and I'm better off alone (Right!)  The lying, the bleeding, the screaming Was tearing me apart The hatred, the beatings (disaster); it's over  (Why?) As wicked as you are You're beautiful to me (Why?) You're the darkest burning star You're my perfect disease  The lying, the bleeding, the screaming Was tearing me apart The hatred, the beatings; it's over Disaster The lying, the bleeding, the screaming Was tearing me apart The hatred, the beatings; it's over Disaster  It's over now
