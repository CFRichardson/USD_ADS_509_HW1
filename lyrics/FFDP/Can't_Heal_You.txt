   The deeper you get, the farther you fall down The closer I get, the more you dissolve  You're lost inside, your pale addictions Bury you, with the demons in the ash  Can't heal you, don't want to 'Cause you can't save your-fuckin'-self Can't heal you, don't need to 'Cause you won't save yourself  You are the one who made the decision Stuck in a prison, shattered and broken I am the one who, expected to heal you, save you from drowning in your endless nightmare Blessed be, the disillusioned The banished misfit and the cursed hollow son  Can't heal you, I don't want to 'Cause you can't save your-fuckin'-self Can't heal you, don't need to 'Cause you won't save yourself  We're taught to perish but fade away Become the haunted and die as slaves  Can't heal you, I don't want to 'Cause you can't save yourself Can't heal you, don't need to 'Cause you won't save yourself Can't heal you, I don't want to 'Cause you can't save your-fuckin'-self Can't heal you, don't need to 'Cause you won't save yourself
