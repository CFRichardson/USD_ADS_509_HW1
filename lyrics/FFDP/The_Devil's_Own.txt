   The Devil's own Why!?  Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be? No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be? When it's said and done, will you remember  Slap on the wrist, smack in the face The family tree, gave me a name and nothing more Neglected seed, why!?  It's because of you I'm broken It's because of you I'm dead inside I never asked to be here It's because of you I'm godforsaken I never wanted this It's because of you I'm dead inside  Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be? No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me What did I do wrong? What was I supposed to be? When it's said and done, will you remember me?  A happy home, a fairy tale, a broken dream Gave me a life, then turned away Killed everything, why!?  It's because of you I'm broken It's because of you I'm dead inside I never asked to be here It's because of you I'm godforsaken I never wanted this It's because of you I'm dead inside  Fuck! Father, bastard, I'm the Devil's very own Mother, know not, just who I've become Father, hate me, for being all you're not Mother's baby, I hate what I've become I hate what I've become I hate what I've become  It's because of you I'm broken It's because of you I'm dead inside  Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be? No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me What did I do wrong? What was I supposed to be? When it's said and done, will you remember me?
