   Oh, fuck it all!  Sick of being sick and tired, sick of understanding (Fuck it all...) Tired of feeling sick to my stomach Demons inside command me They're saying, "Crush it, break it, smash it Fucking kill 'em all!" Laugh as it falls away I won't dodge another silver bullet Just to save a little face  I want you to know, I want you to see I want you to look beyond your own eyes Past your afflictions  How many people really care? How many will be standing? I'll light the match, the flame, the fuse, the bomb Rescue the world from slavery I wanna torch it, burn it, scorch it, fuckin' stomp it out Laugh as it blows away I won't eat another rotten apple Though I've grown to like the taste  I want you to know, I want you to see I want you to look beyond your own eyes Past your afflictions I want you to hurt, want you to bleed I want you to look beyond your own face Past your infections  I'm taking back control with my knuckles I'm taking back control with my knuckles I'm taking back control with my knuckles I'm taking back control with my knuckles  Smash it, burn it, break it, kill it Fuck 'em all!  I want you to know, I want you to see I want you to look beyond your own eyes Past your afflictions I want you to hurt, want you to bleed I want you to look beyond your own face Past your infections
