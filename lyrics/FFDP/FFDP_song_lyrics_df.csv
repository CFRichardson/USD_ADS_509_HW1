You don't understand me And you probably never will I got a tendency to self-destruct And a soft spot for the filth A hair-trigger temperament A switchblade for a tongue I'm a walking one-man genocide With a black belt in corrupt  Everything I touch turns to ashes Falls away, it falls away Everything I touch turns to ashes It slips right through my hands  Love me, hate me Isolate me every day that I'm alive Straight-up mentally unstable You don't have to like my life  I'm a jinx, a curse; some say, ""The worst"" I'm a savage, rabid beast I've been called so many fucking things It doesn't affect me in the least! I've stolen, lied, been crucified But I don't regret a thing I'm an egocentric masochist With a sadist's point of bleak  Everything I touch turns to ashes Falls away, it falls away Everything I touch turns to ashes It slips right through my hands  Love me, hate me Isolate me every day that I'm alive Live to prove you wrong, it's easy When your heart is filled with ice Chapters in my life define me Changed me into this deprived Straight-up mentally unstable You don't have to like my life  Everything I touch turns to ashes Falls away, it falls away Everything I touch turns to ashes It slips right through my hands "
