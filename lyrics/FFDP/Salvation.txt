   Disgusted by your weakness You have no right to live To know you is to hate you But your life's yours to give  You monkey see, you monkey do You're always doing what they tell you to You're such a puppet on a string You don't get it!  I won't bow to something that I've never seen Can't believe in something that doesn't believe in me I'm not blood of your blood, I'm no son of your god I've no faith in your fate Still I find salvation  You think you have the answers to every last detail In your eyes, you're the victor In mine you've all but failed  You monkey see, you monkey do You're always doing what they tell you to You're like a puppet on a string You don't get it! You monkey see, you monkey do You're always doing what they tell you to You're like a puppet on a string You don't get it!  I won't bow to something that I've never seen Can't believe in something that doesn't believe in me I'm not blood of your blood, I'm no son of your god I've no faith in your fate Still I find salvation Still I find salvation Still I find salvation
