   All these thoughts are running through my head I can't control it they are taking me down with them Wish I knew why I am haunted It would be easier to try and start again  And I'd feel like new In a world I'm used to hiding from I'd feel brand new I would know where I stand  All these thoughts are running through my head Head Running through my head Head My head  Wondering if my intentions Will soon replace what is in front of me here and now There is something underlying The melancholy in my mind Lost in the clouds  And I'd feel like new If I could get out of the rainstorms And this would be through I will hold on till then  All these thoughts are running through my head Head Running through my head Head My head
