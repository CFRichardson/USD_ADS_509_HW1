   You're lovely, but looks can kill You're a septic cloud, but I'm breathing still It's not right, you take it all Still I listen, and return your call Oh  Toxin, got my temperature rising Our love finally taking its toll It's incredible how quickly I lost me And I just can't take you no more  You're lowly, you drag me down Just burned up ash left on the ground No vision, you've made me blind Smoke signals burn into my eyes Oh  Toxin, got my temperature rising Our love finally taking its toll It's incredible how quickly I lost me And I just can't take you no more  Na na na, na na na na Nananana, na na na na
