OfficialRezz,Lost,"   What a beautiful world to be anything but alone I can't find a cure, I'm solely losing control How am I supposed to feel when nothing seems real? Who I'm supposed to be when everything I love falls away from me  Why did you chase me if you would erase me? Why would you hold me just to watch me drown? Why would you taste me, slither and snake me? Why would you morph me, oh, tell me, am I lost?  Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Oh, is the darkness fond of me? Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Oh, this is where I'm meant to be  Soften me once more with those mesmerizing eyes Twist around your tongue, clouding me with lies I cut myself open to give it all to you Let you poison my thinking And you love it, I know you do  Why did you chase me if you would erase me? Why would you hold me just to watch me drown? Why would you taste me, slither and snake me? Why would you morph me, oh, tell me, am I lost?  Why did you chase me if you would erase me? Why would you hold me just to watch me drown? Why would you taste me, slither and snake me? Why would you morph me, oh, tell me, am I lost?  Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost? Oh, is the darkness fond of me? Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Oh, this is where I'm meant to be "
OfficialRezz,Melancholy,   All these thoughts are running through my head I can't control it they are taking me down with them Wish I knew why I am haunted It would be easier to try and start again  And I'd feel like new In a world I'm used to hiding from I'd feel brand new I would know where I stand  All these thoughts are running through my head Head Running through my head Head My head  Wondering if my intentions Will soon replace what is in front of me here and now There is something underlying The melancholy in my mind Lost in the clouds  And I'd feel like new If I could get out of the rainstorms And this would be through I will hold on till then  All these thoughts are running through my head Head Running through my head Head My head 
OfficialRezz,Relax,"   Just take a nice breath in. Exhale the breath Just allow yourself now to relax more and more Because the nicest thing about hypnosis Is that wonderful feeling of physical and mental relaxation That can bounce throughout your entire body Because from this moment in time There's nothing, nothing of importance for you to do Except relax  Relax Rela-la-la- Rela-la-la- Rela-la-la- Rela-la-la-  Just take a nice breathe in.
