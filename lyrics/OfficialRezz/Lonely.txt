   Little pieces come my way You say it's just my crazy Little voices feed my pain I feel I've lost my baby  Won't you say my name (Won't you say my name) Say it loud like you know me Somethings not the same (Somethings not the same) You're not here when you hold me Won't you say my name (Won't you say my name) Say it loud like you hold me This is feeling strange You're not here when I'm lonely  Standing but I don't feel pain You hold the knife that slays me Least you know it's not too late You have the power to raise me  Won't you say my name (Won't you say my name) Won't you say my name (Won't you say my name) Won't you say my name (Won't you say my name) You're not here when I'm lonely
