   I shed all my disguises Slipped deep into the silence I've been Haunted by where you have me My self-control is crashing oh Can't make these feelings go  So I'll lie awake again Each night I play pretend I toss and turn, I ache and yearn For rules to bend For you to let me in You to let me in  Haunted by where you have me My self-control is crashing oh Can't make these feelings go So I'll lie awake again Each night I play pretend I toss and turn, I ache and yearn For rules to bend For you to let me in For you to let me in  Surrendered all my violence Fell deep into your quiet I've been Haunted your grip could break me Locked in your gaze I'm shaking Oh Can't make these feelings go So I'll lie awake again Each night I play pretend I toss and turn, I ache and yearn For rules to bend For you to let me in  Haunted by where you have me My self-control is crashing oh Can't make these feelings go So I'll lie awake again Each night I play pretend I toss and turn, I ache and yearn For rules to bend For you to let me in To let me in You to let me in
