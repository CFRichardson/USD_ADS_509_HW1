   What a beautiful world to be anything but alone I can't find a cure, I'm solely losing control How am I supposed to feel when nothing seems real? Who I'm supposed to be when everything I love falls away from me  Why did you chase me if you would erase me? Why would you hold me just to watch me drown? Why would you taste me, slither and snake me? Why would you morph me, oh, tell me, am I lost?  Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Oh, is the darkness fond of me? Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Oh, this is where I'm meant to be  Soften me once more with those mesmerizing eyes Twist around your tongue, clouding me with lies I cut myself open to give it all to you Let you poison my thinking And you love it, I know you do  Why did you chase me if you would erase me? Why would you hold me just to watch me drown? Why would you taste me, slither and snake me? Why would you morph me, oh, tell me, am I lost?  Why did you chase me if you would erase me? Why would you hold me just to watch me drown? Why would you taste me, slither and snake me? Why would you morph me, oh, tell me, am I lost?  Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost? Oh, is the darkness fond of me? Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Am I lost, am I lost, am I lost Oh, this is where I'm meant to be
