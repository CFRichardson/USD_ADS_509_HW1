   And here's my stop, just drop me off And I'll walk the last few hours of night Missing sacred things I had to Leave behind, to solo travel light  I suppose we'll see, start again where we Left off, I can't see how We can ask the past to take us back But it won't, we're too far gone now  Some other world, some other life Some other place, some paradise My fortress made of paper walls And my defenses had to fall Some other world, some other life Some other place, some paradise Somehow the years drove us apart I never could protect your heart  Some other world, some other life Some other place, some paradise My fortress made of paper walls And my defenses had to fall Some other world, some other life Some other place, some paradise Somehow the years drove us apart I never could protect your heart  Every word I say sounds world away From where on earth you've gone A facade, it cracks, like a plastic mask When we talk of moving on  I suppose we'll see, start again where we Left off, I can't say when We can ask the past to take us back But it won't, I'm not that girl I was then  Some other time, some other time Some other world, some other life  Some other world, some other life Some other place, some paradise My fortress made of paper walls And my defenses had to fall Some other world, some other life Some other place, some paradise Somehow the years drove us apart I never could protect your heart  Some other world, some other life Some other place, some paradise My fortress made of paper walls And my defenses had to fall Some other world, some other life Some other place, some paradise Somehow the years drove us apart I never could protect your heart
